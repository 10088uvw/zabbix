A......... [ZBX-19815] fixed 1.8 import to 5.0: when IPMI IP field has DNS name instead of IP, where there are no value maps assigned to items and no proxies assigned to host, with SNMP items that somehow lost their references, when importing hosts into templates and vice versa; fixed 2.0 import to 5.0: when items, LLD rules and item prototypes have missing SNMP v3 fields "snmpv3_contextname", "snmpv3_authprotocol", "snmpv3_privprotocol" and "logtimefmt" field, with LLD rules that became unsupported in 2.2 which resulted in undefined offsets, with templates having screens, when SNMP trap items are present and use same SNMP interfaces as SNMPv1, SNMPv2 or SNMPv3 items (Ivo)
